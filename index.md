The [White House Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp), [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), the [Department of Education](http://www.ed.gov/), and [DC Legal Hackers](http://dclegalhackers.org/) invite you to an Accessibility Hackathon on March 31, 2015.

Federal websites are, by law, designed to be accessible to everyone – individuals who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, or have mobility issues – and we want you to help us develop shareable solutions to some digital accessibility problems facing Government and users today.

This Accessibility Hackathon will feature experts discussing this work, networking opportunities, and the opportunity to make a real difference on these issues.
