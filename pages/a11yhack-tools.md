### Standards and Law

* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) for website accessibility
* [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/) Standards developed by the U.S. Access Board through a process that involves industry, government, consumers, international representatives and others. Federal agencies are required to follow the Section 508 Standards in order to comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Furthermore, the 508 Standards may be used by non-federal entities as well as a way to show commitment and leadership to making technology accessible and usable for people with disabilities. These guidelines and standards are well known and there is over a decade of experience in using them
* Standards for telecommunications services providers and equipment in the [Communications Act at Section 255](http://www.access-board.gov/telecomm/). Rules at 49 CFR Part 6, Access to Telecommunications Service, Telecommunications Equipment and Customer Premises Equipment by Persons with Disabilities, provide extensive requirements on how to design and develop for disability accessibility and usability. Similarly, rules at 49 CFR Part 7, Access to Voicemail and Interactive Menu Services and Equipment by People with Disabilities, provide extensive operational requirements to ensure such interfaces work for people with disabilities
* U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: [Definition of the Term Disability](http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/902cm.html) from The Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments Act Of 2008 (ADAAA)
